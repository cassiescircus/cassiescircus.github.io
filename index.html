	        <p><em>I have been a self-managed, go getter for more than 10 years. I prioritize my time well, I easily learn new systems on the fly, and I always set out to streamline processes as much as possible. As I currently work for a smaller company, many of the processes that are used today are ones of my own design. I am at my best when trying to work out creative solutions to issues, and I strive in environments that are constantly changing and growing.</em></p>
